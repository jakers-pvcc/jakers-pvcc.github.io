<p style="font-family: Georgia; font-size: 13pt; margin-left: 300px; margin-right: 300px; text-align: left;">
		The fillibuster is an essential part of America's democratic process that allows senators to stall out the passage of specific bills or referendums. 
		When the votes for these bills or referendums are held, a senator may ask to speak prior to the vote, and if they are allowed, then they may speak for as long as they prefer.

<h2 style="color:#89cff0; font-family: Georgia; margin-left: 300px; margin-right: 300px; text-align: left;">How was the Fillibuster created?</h2>
<p style="font-family: Georgia; font-size: 13pt; margin-left: 300px; margin-right: 300px; text-align: left;">
	While the actual "father" of the filibuster is attributed to Aaron Burr, it is known that the strategy of using long speeches to delay the passage of bills goes all the way back to the very first senate session.
	In fact, on September 22nd, 1789, Senator William Maclay of Pennsylvania wrote a diary entry pertaining to the strategy, stating, "[The] design of Virginians ... was to talk away the time, so that we could not get the bill passed."
	Eventually, the act of making long speeches to elongate the legislative process became an incredibly popular stall tactic for politicians, and the name "fillibuster" - derived from the Spanish word "filibusteros" - was born to describe these speeches.

<h2 style="color:#89cff0; font-family: Georgia; margin-left: 300px; margin-right: 300px; text-align: left;">Noteworthy Filibusters</h2>
<p style="font-family: Georgia; font-size: 13pt; margin-left: 300px; margin-right: 300px; text-align: left;">
	One of the most famous fillibusters in history was performed by Senator Wayne Morse of Oregon in the 1950s to educate the public on issues he deemed of incredible national importance.
	However, the record for the longest fillibuster speech goes to Senator Thurmond of South Carolina, who spoke for a whopping 24 hours and 18 minutes with very few breaks for rest.

<p style="font-family: Georgia; font-size: 13pt; margin-left: 300px; margin-right: 300px; text-align: left;">
	While many see the fillibuster as an important democratic tool, there are others who think differently on the subject. 
	Some individuals look at the fillibuster and describe it as a "waste of time" and a "threat to the bipartisan process."
	For instance, one of the most controversial fillibusters happened in 1964, when Senators Hubert Humphrey and Everett Dirksen led a "fillibuster campaign" against the passage of the 1964 Civil Rights Act.
	While it was not the longest individual speech or fillibuster, it heavily hampered the the senate, and at times brought the democratic process to a grinding halt for little gain.

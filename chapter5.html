<p style="font-weight: bold;">Phases of Computer Program Development:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Phase 1: Understanding the problem.</li>
	<li>Phase 2: Design an algorithm to solve said problem.</li>
	<li>Phase 3: Write the program code in an appropriate language based on the algorithm.</li>
	<li>Phase 4: Enter the program and save.</li>
	<li>Phase 5: Execute the program.</li>
	<li>Phase 6: Test program, find errors and debugs, then retest.</li>
	<li>Phase 7: Document and evaluate program.</li>
</ul>

<p style="font-weight: bold;">Programming Structures:</p>
	<p style="margin-left: 50px;">Sequential Structure: Top-Down Execution.</p>
	<p style="margin-left: 50px;">Decision Structures: If/Then/Else.</p>

<p style="font-weight: bold;">Iterative (Looping):</p>
	<p style="margin-left: 50px">While Loop: Continue looping something as long as it is true.</p>
	<p style="margin-left: 50px">Repeat/Until Looping: continue looping until something is true.</p>
	<p style="margin-left: 50px">For Loop: loop a given number of times.</p>

<p style="font-weight: bold;">Recursive Structures:</p>
	<p style="margin-left: 50px;">Repeat a set of instructions as a subtask of itself.</p>
	<p style="margin-left: 50px; font-weight: bold;">Repitition continues until:</p>
		<p style="margin-left: 100px;">degenerative case, which is a termination condition, is met.</p>
		<p style="margin-left: 100px;">(degenerative case is also called a "base case")</p>

<p style="font-weight: bold;">Two classic programming/database problems</p>
	<p style="margin-left: 50px; font-weight: bold;">Sorting: Descending order/Ascending Order</p>
		<p style="margin-left: 100px;">Sorting numbers</p>
		<p style="margin-left: 100px;">Sorting strings (in accordance with ASCII values</p>
	<p style="margin-left: 50px; font-weight: bold;">Searching: find specific data that meet a certain criteria</p>
		<p style="margin-left: 100px; font-weight: bold;">In database:</p>
			<p style="margin-left: 150px;">Filters: Temporary Search</p>
			<p style="margin-left: 150px;">Queries: Search criteria are saved so they don't have to be recreated</p>
	<p style="margin-left: 50px; font-weight: bold;">Two Popular Search Techniques:</p>
		<p style="margin-left: 100px;">Sequential Search: search from top to bottom or from bottom to top, one item at a time.</p>
		<p style="margin-left: 100px; font-weight: bold;">Binary Search:</p>
			<p style="margin-left: 150px;">Only works if data is SORTED first</p>
			<p style="margin-left: 150px;">Start in the middle, then go to half of that, etc.</p>
		
<p style="font-weight: bold;">Two classic program goals:</p>
	<p style="margin-left: 50px;">Efficiency: Program takes minimal time and/or resources</p>
	<p style="margin-left: 50px;">Correctness: Program runs in expected ways and works for all expected conditions</p>

	<tr>
		<td>Regression Testing</td>
		<td>Checking whether new features break or degrade functionality. Sanity testing can be used to verify menus, functions and commands at the surface level, when there is no time for a regression test.</td>

	<tr>
		<td>Stress Testing</td>
		<td>Testing how much strain the system can take before it fails. Considered to be a type of non-functional testing.</td>

	<tr>
		<td>Usability Testing</td>
		<td>Validating how well a customer can use a system or web application to complete a task.</td>

<p style="font-weight: bold;">Software testing is done to detect:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Architextural flaws</li>
	<li>Poor design decisions</li>
	<li>Invalid or incorrect functionality</li>
	<li>Security Vulnerabilities</li>
	<li>Scalability issues</li>
</ul>

<p style="font-weight: bold;">Testing best practices:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Continuous Testing: Doing tests across the programs multiple builds decreases the odds of bugs or glitching appearing later.</li>
	<li>Configuration Management: Usually a process dedicated to a separate team. They navigate different builds and determine which ones to test.</li>
	<li>Service Virtualization: Since a testing environment may not be available, service virtualization simulates the environment for the program.</li>
	<li>Bug Tracking: Monitoring defects within the program automatically to keep track of them.</li>
	<li>Metrics and Reporting: Share information across teams to insure code is kept linear and consistent.</li>
</ul>

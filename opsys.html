			<td>Term</td>
			<td>Definition</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>Operating System</td>
			<td>Software that controls the overall operation of a computer. Allows users to store and retrieve files, and offers an interface where a user can execute programs</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>Job Queue</td>
			<td>Internal registry that holds programs in preparation for execution</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>Interactive Processing</td>
			<td>Allows a program to carry a "dialogue" with user while in the process of execution</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>Time-Sharing</td>
			<td>An internal system that allows operating systems to service multiple users at a time</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>Multiprogramming</td>
			<td>A form of program execution in which time is divided into intervals and then the execution of a single program is restricted to one interval</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>Application Software</td>
			<td>Programs for performing tasks particular to the machine's utilization</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>System Software</td>
			<td>Performs tasks that are generally common to computers</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>Utility Software</td>
			<td>Programs that perform activities that are fundemental to computer installations. Not included in the operating system</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>Graphical User Interface (GUI)</td>
			<td>Represent items that can be manipulated (files, programs, etc.) in a visual form</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>Shell</td>
			<td>Older form of user interface that displays files or programs via text</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>Kernel</td>
			<td>Contains non-visual software components that perform very basic functions required by computers</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>Device Driver</td>
			<td>Software units that communicate with controllers</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>File Manager</td>
			<td>Software that coordinates the use of the system's storage facilities</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>Memory Manager</td>
			<td>Software in charge of coordinating the use of the system's main memory</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>Virtual Memory</td>
			<td>Memory created by the movement of "PAGES" that allows the computer to access information quickly</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>Boot Strapping</td>
			<td>Allows the computer to start by retrieving the operating system from mass storage each time the computer is turned on</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>ROM</td>
			<td>Section of main memory that is nonvolatile. Allows the CPU to access the operating system</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>Deadlock</td>
			<td>A problem that can occur between processes when two processes require resources that allocated to another</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>Spooling</td>
			<td>Operation to prevent deadlock that works by creating "fake access" to resources that don't exist. This way, the program can be tricked into thinking it has access, and can later be given proper access to those resources when they are available</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>Super-User</td>
			<td>An account with the highest level of priveledge on an operating system</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>Multi-Factor Authentication</td>
			<td>More secure than single-factor authentication. Requires two or more separate "keys" to access an account</td>
		</tr>
